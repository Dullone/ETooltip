#Description
ETooltip adds a summary to the tooltip of an item with relevant information on secondary stat increases including: milestones reached and bonuses from them, converts ratings into secondary stat estimates, as well as consolidates information from multiple bonuses (ex + critical severity from 2 primary stats will be shown added together instead of separately).

Displayed stats:

Item power - A raw number which represents the item budget (higher = more powerful)
Stat summary - Summary of stat increases
Rating conversion Ratings to secondary stat conversions
Milestone checking - Did you hit or lose a milestone with this item?
Rune valuations - How powerful are runes when inserted?
Fully configurable options - Choose what you want displayed
